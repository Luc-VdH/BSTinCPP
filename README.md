# Binary Search Tree Implimented in C++
Continuing from my implimentation of a linked list in C++, this program lets
user store strings in a BST and then check if a string has been stored. The
goal of this was a learning experience to better my understanding of C++ and
pointers. To run the program use the "make" command which will build and run
the program.
